# Programming Snippets (Python, MATLAB/Simulink, C/C++)

Curated collection of reusable, idiomatic, and well-documented snippets. Each snippet is self-contained, with prerequisites, complexity, and minimal test/usage example.

## Goals
- **Quality**: consistent style, linting, automatic formatting.
- **Portability**: avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- **Educational**: concise explanations and links to resources.

## How to navigate

- [`Python/`](Python/): general utilities (decorators, robust I/O, etc.)
- [`MATLAB/`](MATLAB/): signal processing, numerical utilities.
- [`Simulink/`](Simulink/): `.slx` models with README and screenshots.
- [`C/`](C/): lightweight data structures and embedded patterns.
- [`Cpp/`](Cpp/): idiomatic header-only (RAII, traits, etc.)
